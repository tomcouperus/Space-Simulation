# Jupiter Asteroid Simulation

## How to make experiment
The base situation is the `Basic Setup` scene in the Unity project.
Any time you want to test some deviation, copy the scene and rename it. 
Follow the instructions in the Debug Log on what to do.
The results of that simulation will be saved in the `Data` folder in a file with the same name as the scene.

**Make sure to stop play mode in the editor to properly finish the json object**
